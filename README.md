## **Proposal 5: Breakin30 - a information cocoon breaker**

### What and why?

In today's world, individuals are frequently labeled and categorized by various recommendation systems. While these systems do enhance efficiency and keep users engaged within a single app, they also confine users within specific types of information and interests. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as the "information cocoon." The continuous influx of similar content serves to polarize our perspectives by obstructing our exposure to diverse information.

Our app has a clear mission: to dismantle the information cocoon. We are committed to challenging the dominance of recommendation systems and providing our users with a healthy dose of randomness. 

### For whom?
- people who are sick of same content every day and want some new information
- people with interesting souls and willing to share with others
- people who don't want to spend hours on phone

### How?
- At specific, predetermined times, we deliver one image, one text snippet, and one video to our users. For instance, this could include a captivating image of a painting or an informative video on the art of making fried chicken.

- We actively encourage user engagement with our content. In a fixed 30-minute window, users have the opportunity to react to the content, generate their own content, and give credit to fellow contributors. This fosters a sense of community-driven knowledge sharing and interaction.

- Much like BeReal, our app allows users to connect with friends within the platform, but it eschews traditional chat features. People could see interactions for a post from friends only to avoid additional comment censorship. Instead, we emphasize the importance of content and knowledge exchange as the primary means of interaction, promoting meaningful connections based on shared interests and curiosity.

### Scope
- The system need to grab information from websites or from existing database to deliver information for users. We might also need a censorship algo for content that users give.
